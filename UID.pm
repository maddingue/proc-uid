=head1 NAME

Proc::UID - Manipulate a variety of UID and GID settings.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Proc::UID;

=head1 WARNING

This release of Proc::UID is for testing and review purposes only.
Please do not use it in production code.  The interface may change,
and the underlying code has not yet been rigourously tested.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl only has concepts of effective and real UIDs, whereas a
number of operating systems have further concepts, such as saved
UIDs.  This module is intended to provide a way for those additional
UIDs to be manipulated.

A number of functions are provided to perform logical operations,
such as irrevocably dropping privileges.

=head1 BUGS

Many operating systems have different interfaces into their
extra UIDs.  This module has not yet been tested under all of
them.
